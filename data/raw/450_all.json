Zahid can answer your queries. Remember that this channel is additional to the office hours and emails that you can send to us. In order to make things effective and streamlined, please follow these guidelines:1. On the top of the dashboard, you will find several folders (Ex: hw1, lab1, project, midterm, logistics, etc.). To help your classmates and us to keep track of them, make sure to post your question on the respective folder.2. Make sure to write your questions as clearly as possible. If you need to add some screenshots or other information, please do so.3. Before posting a question, make sure that you have checked previous posts so that we do not have a repeated question that has been already solved.4. We encourage you to respond unanswered questions from your classmates. Learning is a collaborative work and any additional help is appreciated.5. Please DO NOT share any part of your homework, lab or project on Piazza. Any violations will be taken very seriously.If you have any other doubts about the class' logistics feel free to add a question or reply to this announcement.Cheers,Chinmay",

However, I didn't capture the HTTP post at the beginning. Instead, I captured the HTTP Post at the end of the uploading (when it's finished the uploading).This is a screenshot of \"tcp-ethereal-trace-1\", the packet trace file provided by the textbook. I use it for this lab.  As you can see, there's no such HTTP post file at the beginning of the trace.At the end of the uploading process, it captured a HTTP post packetI'm very confused about the time when it captured the POST packet. Shouldn't the POST packet be captured right after we build TCP connection with the server?If that order is correct, how can I tell the RTT of the first 6 segments includingPOST packet as the first segment?",

So segment no. 155(ack no 3160) in your screenshot is acknowledgement for segment no 130 (Seq=1),131(Seq=714),132(Seq=2162).Here are some snippets from TCPRFCfor further details:The acknowledgment mechanism employed is cumulative so that an acknowledgment of sequence number X indicates that all octets up to but not including X have been received (Page 23)Acknowledgment Number:  32 bitsIf the ACK control bit is set this field contains the value of the next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to receive.  Once a connection is established this is always sent.

The following four packets have a total size of 5840, which makes sense since that's the window size the server advertised at the beginning of the session.My question is about the highlighted packet of size 892.

That isRTS duration field = RTS duration = SIFS + CTS + SIFS + Data + SIFS + ACKThis is the CTS frame, and you notice it is shorter (since you don’t have to identify the transmitting MAC address (Only the AP can send the CTS).

It isRTS duration field = RTS duration = SIFS + Data + SIFS + ACKMost of the time, both RTS and CTS frames are unicast.

Or, do we make a new socket every time the client sends and receives a message from serverM?2. Am I correct to say that the client TCP port is the only port that will be generated dynamically?3. From the table below, it seems like the passwords can include spaces. Since the passwords can include special characters as well, are we allowed to send the password  from the client in one TCP message and the username in a separate TCP message to serverM?

            "content": "Hello,Hopefully my understanding of the UDP code and client server process is correct, otherwise none of my questions will make sense below.So from beej's networking guide (link), it seems like part of the process of communication from a client to a server is for the client to ensure it's setting up it's socket so that it has compatible socket address parameters with the server. In the screenshot below, the getaddrinfo function is used by the server to set up a socket based on the parameters specified (i.e ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_flags). However, on the client side, they populate these parameters so that they match the parameters of the server that they'resendingto.So does that then mean that the following needs to be the same on the clientandserver side:ai_family --> this is IPv4 or IPv6ai_soctype --> it's clear that this will be SOCK_DGRAM from both the client and the server so no questions hereai_protocol --> beej uses a default of 0 for the server and client hereOther Questions:What do we do if, for example, serverM is using IPv4 on Port #23000 (just an example) and serverC is using IPv6? Do I have to use port #23000to send UDP messages to serverC? Or can I open a separate socket for M so that it becomes a \"client\" and then the program canintentionallypick a socket that is compatible with serverC.OR, should I just make sure that all servers are set up exactly the same and are therefore are all running under the same IP family (beej uses IPv6 so that is what I would default to)? If I set them all up in the same way, then I won't have to make sure the sockets are compatible every time I send a message between the servers - that is my understanding?Basically what I'm trying to ask is how do you ensure communication is compatible between twoserversin UDP? It's not an issue with client/servers because the client will always pick a socket that as parameters that matches the server or return an error. But with servers, once you turn them on (i.e set up the socket), they shouldn't suddenly change their parameters. It feels like a deadlock in a way.",

If the mapping above is correct, then in the SYNACK frame, why is the source shown to be the router (MAC address: 00:16:b6:f4:eb:a8)? Based on lecture, shouldn't the AP be the source (address 2) and the router be placed in address 3?

Then the question remains why do L2 switches need MAC addresses though? Unfortunately we discuss this in EE555. Switches need to communicate with other switches to prevent loops from occurring using a Protocol called \"Spanning Tree Protocol\". In that Protocol, switches need to identify their MAC addresses to each other. Further more, MAC addresses of switches are needed to enable Network Admin the ability to \"manage\" switches remotely.Stay safe and healthyP.S.

Could the connection between the two be FDX since switches can support this or not since hubs do not support FDX? Is there some sort of hierarchy at play that I'm completely missing here?For hubs, we see that the link would get the 1/N average throughput across it (N being the number of nodes) whereas for switches, we see that the link would get the full dedicated link throughput, so I am under the impression that this distinction is important to calculating the network throughput.Even after re-watching the discussion and the relevant lecture and textbook section, I am still confused about how we can determine throughput of this network.In the discussion, the TA showed that the rate in either direction of hub-switch link would be possibly different (ex: R1 = (1/7 x 4)4R and R2 = 4R).In the case that the hub-switch link is HDX I don't understand the role that these R1 and R2 values would play in the throughput calculation for the network as a wholeIf the link truly is FDX, then are the switch to hub links just 1Gbps in each direction and overwhelm the the departmental network? Or, does this link get a throughput of 1/4Gbps and not utilize the whole link despite being a dedicated link?",

But sometimes my main server receives the error of course not found from the department backend server, in this case I am technically sending something to the client to indicate this error, but should I still print this message? Also, sometimes my main server does not even contact a department server because it detects that the course code does not begin in CS or EE so must be invalid - should I print this message in these cases too?Thanks!",

Therefore, the port number will change. However, as long as it is a dynamic port, we should be fine, correct? I am asking because I saw that we need to keep the port same in previous posts. But in post @367, I was informed that as long as it is dynamic then it will be fine.Regarding the second question in @367, if we are required to keep the client dyanmic port the same, when I close the client and open it again without restarting the main server, my server will not respond to the new open client anymore. Is this ok? Will I get points deducted? But if we are allowed to create a new socket every time the client communicates, then I can definitely solve this problem.Thanks in advance.",

You do not have to worry about the pointer.2. Use formal argument (parameter). Send \"ans\" this array to the \"whatever\" function as a formal argument. Then you can directly change the \"ans\" in the function. The \"ans\" in your main function will be changed at the same time.I think the problem of your code is1. Your return type is char. You want send a char array back. This is not gonna work. You need to use char * as your return type at least.2. Return * ret means the value of address ret. If you do not add a location about this array, * ret is *ret[0] as default, which is the value of the first character in your char array. That's the situation you have in your first picture. What you might want to do is to send the address of this array back, you can not return the value of a char array.char * whatever (...) { char * ret = ... ;  ....  return ret;}3. When you receive the return value, you also cannot receive a char array. You can only can the return value of a char variable of the address of a char array.char * ans; ans = whatever(...);4. When you output a char array by %s, make sure your char array is ended by a '\\0'.Just give you these suggestions in case you still want to use pointer and char array, but I recommend \"string\" if you want to solve it faster.  I think the instructor is right, you might want to work more on the pointer, and also the return value of a function, and also char array.",

Would the only way to close the sockets in this case be to close them in the SIGINT handler or something?I read online that the OS will eventually disconnect these sockets, but I find it annoying for these sockets to remain in use and I have to wait a bit in between subsequent runs. Is there a simple way to reduce this time before the sockets are cleared or something of the sort?

For each node, if a node is its neighbor, assign the cost. Otherwise, assign it as inifinity.Step 2: Assume we do it inalphabetical order. We start from A. We use distance vectors of B and E to update A. Then we move on to B, which we use distance vectors of C, E, and A to update B. After that, we do the same thing for C, D, and E. Then this is counted as one iteration.Step 3: Repeat step 2.Is this the procedure what we should follow? There are just some small questions. For example, is it ok to do it in alphabetical order because I believe doing in different order will result in different values. Additionally, I feel like the number of steps are getting larger and larger when the number of nodes goes up. How many nodes are we going to have in final.Thank you very much.",

Since we can know this message is sent by Alice, which means this is not sent by other people, doesn't this ensure the integrity at the same time?
